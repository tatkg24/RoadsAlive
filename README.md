# RoadsAlive
Roads Alive is a data visualization project which utilizes open data from the City of Kelowna. Specifically, it incorporates data about the numerous roads in the city employing their unique characteristics such as name, bounds, perceived traffic, and classification to create a visualization that explores the complexity and beauty of urban road networks. Using P5.js, this project visualizes roadways as squiggly lines that vary in thickness based on traffic volume, with different colours representing different types of roads. When a user hovers over a line, they can see information about the road it represents.

# Installation
TBD. 

# Usage
Hover over a road to see information about it.
Explore the map to see how different types of roads contribute to the overall road network.
Consider the implications of traffic patterns and road types on urban planning and infrastructure development.
